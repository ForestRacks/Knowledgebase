# Fix Account Not Found
If you encounter an error message stating "No account matching those credentials could be found" while accessing the [ForestRacks Game Panel](https://panel.forestracks.com/), it is likely that you simply forgot your password or your password did not synchronize properly from the billing system. Although this occurrence is infrequent, it can happen. If you experience this issue, follow the steps below to resolve it.

<Steps>
### Reset Your Password
Visit the [Forgot Password Page](https://panel.forestracks.com/auth/password) and initiate the password reset process. This will allow you to set a new password for your account.

### Check Your Spam Folder
After resetting your password, check your email account's spam or junk folder. This is also an infreqent occurance because we use AmazonSES to send mail which is seen as reputable by other mail servers but sometimes, automated emails can be misidentified and redirected to spam. Look for an email from ForestRacks regarding your password reset.
