# Installing Spark

Spark is a plugin that allows you to monitor your server's performance. It is a great tool to use when trying to find lag sources.
To use Spark, make sure you are Temurin, Prime, or GraalVM. OpenJ9 will not work.

1. Download Spark from the [Spigot Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spark.57242/)
2. Log into the [ForestRacks Control Panel](https://panel.forestracks.com).
3. Navigate to your server and click on the `File Manager` tab.
4. Navigate to the `plugins` folder.
5. Click on the `Upload` button and upload the Spark jar file.
