# Logging into RCON Pavlov VR

## Pavlov RCON Tool
You can log into RCON using the [Pavlov RCON Tool](https://pavlovhorde.com/rcon/) with your credentials from the [ForestRacks game server panel](https://panel.forestracks.com).

* The IP Address for signing in is the one found on the "Network" panel tab which should look something like `192.168.53.72`
* The RCON port is found on the "Startup" panel tab in the `RCON PORT` input box.
* The password is also found on the "Startup" panel tab but its in the `RCON PASSOWRD` input.

If you decide to change the RCON password, you can do so by modifying it in the `RCON PASSOWRD` input and then simply clicking "Restart" on the "Console" panel tab.

## Troubleshooting
1) If you get the error saying "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'playerList') Please Refresh the Page", it means your login credentials are incorrect. Make sure you clicked Restart after setting the password, you have the correct IP and port, and you don't have any spaces before or after the IP and port.
