# Waiting for RCON to come up... Error

When you receive this error it means that there are not 2 allocated ports on your server and you must open a ticket to get this fix.The other way to check it is to see what your rcon port is and make sure that it lines up with the port in the oxide.config or else rcon wont load and your server will end up crashing.
