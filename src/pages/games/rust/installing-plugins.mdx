# Installing Rust Oxide Plugins

When you are wanting to install a plugin you will need to one make sure oxide is installed and two you have the .cs file off of umod.org.When you have downloaded the .cs you will go to the Oxide folder then the Plugins folder.The server may stay running while installing plugins just will have a little lag spike.When you make it to the folder all you need to do is drag the files from your pc over to the control panel and let the copy there and in the console the name of the plugin will show up and say "Configuration file created".
