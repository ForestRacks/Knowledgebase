# Finding what to delete on Linux

## Clearing Docker Files
```bash copy
docker container prune -f ;
docker image prune -f ;
docker network prune -f ;
docker volume prune -f
```

## Deleting Old System Logs
Let's Encrypt:
```bash copy
rm /var/log/letsencrypt/*
```
Recursively delete old .gz logs:
```bash copy
find /var/log -type f -name "*.gz" -exec rm -i {} \;
```

## Remove Old System Packages
```bash copy
apt autoremove
```

## Deleting old Kernels
```
apt -y install byobu
purge-old-kernels
```
### Or Manually:
Check what Kernel you are currently using so you can make sure you don't delete it:
```bash copy
uname -r
```
List installed Kernels
```bash copy
dpkg --list | grep linux-image
```
Delete specific kernel versions:
```bash copy
apt purge linux-image-<version>-generic
```
