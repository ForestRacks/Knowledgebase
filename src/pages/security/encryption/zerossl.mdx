# Using ZeroSSL

ZeroSSL is a Sectigo reseller that provides cheap SSL certificates for both FQDNs and IP addresses. ZeroSSL is free for the first three 90-day certificates, and then $10/month for unlimited certificate after that. The certificates are issued by Sectigo, which is a trusted CA.

Unfortunately ZeroSSL does not allow redistribution of their certificates, so companies cannot use ZeroSSL to issue certificates to their customers. However, ZeroSSL is a great option for companies that want to issue certificates to their own servers.
