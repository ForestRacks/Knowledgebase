# Using Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt is a certificate authority that provides free SSL certificates. The only downsides of Let's Encrypt are that they don't release a list of the IPs they issue certificates with so you cant have a firewall and the second downside is they don't support IP certificates.

## Install Certbot

    #### Downloading Certbot
    To begin, we will install certbot, a simple script that automatically renews our certificates and allows much easier creation of them. The command below is for Ubuntu distributions, but you can always check [Certbot's official site](https://certbot.eff.org/) for installation instructions. We have also included a command below to install certbot's Apache plugin so you won't have to stop your webserver.
    ```bash copy
    apt update
    apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

    #### Completing the HTTP Challenge
    1) Make sure you have port 80 open on your firewall
    2) Request a certificate from Let's Encrypt, you should replace `example.com` with the domain you would like to generate a certificate for.
    ```bash copy
    certbot certonly --nginx -d example.com
    ```

    ### Automatically Renewing SSL/TLS certificates
    1) Install crontab:
    ```bash copy
    apt install cron
    ```
    2) Create a crontab rule for the automatic renewal:
    ```bash copy
    (crontab -l ; echo "0 23 * * * certbot renew --quiet --deploy-hook \"systemctl restart nginx\"")| crontab -
    ```
