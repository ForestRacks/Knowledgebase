# Using Adnauseam

Adnauseam is a browser extension fork of uBlock Origin that clicks on every ad on every page you visit in the background while simultaneously blocking trackers. This both makes it impossible for advertisers to fingerprint you since you are seamingly interested in everything and costs companies a ton in click fees. It's available for Firefox and Chrome.
