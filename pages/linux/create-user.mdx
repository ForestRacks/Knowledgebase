# Create a Linux User with a Specific Home Directory
<Steps>
### Open Terminal
Open a terminal or log in to your Linux system.
### Create User
Run the following command to create a user named `linuxuser`:
```bash copy
useradd -G sudo -s /bin/bash -m -d /srv/linuxuser linuxuser
```
This command creates the user `linuxuser`, assigns the primary group as `linuxuser`, and adds the user to the `docker` and `sudo` groups. The `-s /bin/bash flag` sets the default shell for the user, while `-m` creates the home directory if it doesn't exist, and `-d /srv/bitwarden` specifies the desired home directory.
### Grant File Access
Set the ownership of the home directory to the linuxuser user by executing:
```bash copy
chown -R linuxuser: /srv/linuxuser
```
This command ensures that the user `linuxuser` has full ownership of the `/srv/linuxuser` directory and all its contents.
