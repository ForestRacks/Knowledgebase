Terminate an SSH Session
To terminate an SSH session, follow the steps below:

List the active SSH sessions by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
who
```
This will display the currently active sessions.

Identify the process ID (PID) associated with the SSH session you wish to terminate. Use the netstat command in conjunction with grep to filter the results. Execute the following command:
```bash
netstat -tnp | grep '192.168.53.72'
```
This will provide output similar to the following:

```shell
# tcp        0      0 MACHINE_IP:22     192.168.53.72:20500    ESTABLISHED 3368682/sshd: root
```
Note down the PID value (e.g., 3368682), as it will be used in the next step.

Terminate the SSH session by killing the process associated with the identified PID. Run the following command:
```bash
kill -9 3368682
```
This command will forcefully terminate the SSH session.

Please exercise caution when terminating SSH sessions, as this action will immediately disconnect any ongoing connections.
