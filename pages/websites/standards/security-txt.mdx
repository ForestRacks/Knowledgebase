# Basics of using security.txt

security.txt is a text file used by website owners to share security disclosure contact information. This short documentation page will guide you through the basics of creating and using a proper security.txt file.

## Understanding security.txt Standards
To ensure proper usage of `security.txt`, it is recommended to follow the standards provided by [securitytxt.org](https://securitytxt.org/). This website offers guidelines on creating and managing a security.txt file. It is essential to familiarize yourself with these standards to achieve the desired results.


## Creating a standard security.txt file
1) Open a text editor or any preferred text editing software.
2) Start a new file and save it as "security.txt".
3) Begin by adding the following lines to define security policies:
```bash
# Our security address
Contact: mailto:security@example.com

# Our OpenPGP key
Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt

# Our security policy
Policy: https://example.com/security-policy.htmI

# Our security acknowledgments page
Acknowledgments: https://example.com/hall-of-fame.html
```

## Additional Directives
Apart from the directives exampled above, there are other directives you can use in your security.txt file to provide specific instructions to web robots. Some common directives include:

* **Expires**: The date and time when the content of the security.txt file should be considered stale (so security researchers should then not trust it).

* **Hiring**: A link to any security-related job openings in your organisation.

* **Preferred-Languages**: A comma-separated list of language codes that your security team speaks. You may include more than one language.

Make sure to refer to the securitytxt.org website for detailed information on these directives and their usage.


## Deploying your security.txt file
To make your security.txt file accessible to web robots, you need to upload it at the `.well-known` directory of your website. Once deployed, it should be accessible at the following location: https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt where `example.com` is your sites domain.
