# Installing Fiber

<Steps>
### Install Go
Get the latest version of Go from [the official Golang website](https://golang.org/dl/) and follow the instructions.

### Create Go Project

#### Initialize App
```bash copy
go mod init demo
```

#### Create main.go
Now create a file called main.go in the project directory write the following code in it:
```go filename="main.go" copy
package main

import (
    "log"

    "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
    app := fiber.New()

    app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        return c.SendString("Hello, World ðŸ‘‹!")
    })

    log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3000"))
}
```
The above code is actually the bare-bones to get the server respond with `Hello, World ðŸ‘‹!`

#### Create go.mod
Save the file and run the following command to update your `go.mod`
```bash copy
go mod tidy
```
This will create a go.sum file that ensures that future downloads of these modules retrieve the same bits as the first download, to ensure the modules your project depends on do not change unexpectedly, whether for malicious, accidental, or other reasons

```
Your project folder should contain the following file structure:
/ProjectDirectory
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
  â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
  â””â”€â”€ go.sum
```

#### Run App
Let's launch our app by calling the following command:
```bash copy
go run main.go
```
