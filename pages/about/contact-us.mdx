# How to contact ForestRacks support?
The quickest way to contact us is [Discord](https://discord.forestracks.com). However, this is reserved sales inquiries and general issues that are not associated with your account.

[Tickets](https://my.forestracks.com/submitticket) are another option, these are recommended for low urgency issues that may take a while for us to investigate.

The last option is our social media and forums. we have a Twitter, Linkedin, and Instagram. All of these have a slow response time but we will try our best to get back to you.
