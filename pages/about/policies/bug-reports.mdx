## Bug Bounty Rewards
We value the contributions of security researchers and ethical hackers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. While we do not pay ransoms, we do offer monetary rewards for responsible disclosure. The amount of the reward will be determined based on the severity of the reported vulnerability and its potential impact. Rewards may range from $10 to $1,000.

### Eligibility for Rewards
To be eligible for a reward, you must:

- Discover a previously unknown vulnerability __in software ForestRacks created__. If you have questions about whether or not something is made by us, please contact our security team.
- Report the vulnerability promptly and responsibly following our disclosure guidelines.
- Avoid disclosing the vulnerability publicly before it has been resolved and you receive our approval to disclose it.
- Provide a detailed report that includes clear steps to reproduce the issue.
