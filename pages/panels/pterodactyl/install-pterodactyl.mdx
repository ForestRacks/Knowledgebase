# Installing Pterodactyl
This guide walks you through the process of using our a custom Pterodactyl Panel installation bash script to easily setup Pterodactyl Panel. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, our troubleshooting section has some helpful tips.

## Installation:
<Steps>
### Reinstall
To get started, it's important to ensure that your machine is freshly reinstalled if you've made any changes to it beforehand. 
### Create DNS Record
Point a DNS A-Record to your machine's IP address, such as `panel.example.com` to `192.168.53.72`.
### Execute Installer
To download and run the installer, simply enter the following command into your terminal and follow the prompts:
```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForestRacks/PteroInstaller/Production/install.sh || wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForestRacks/PteroInstaller/Production/install.sh) auto
```
Note: There will be a prompt with three installation modes, "basic mode" is recommended for people who know very little about linux or want to create a test environment since it automates the entire setup process.
### Post Install
After the installation is complete, go to `http://<domain>/admin/nodes/view/1/allocation` to add the necessary ports for your games.
Note: `<domain>` refers to the panel URL you set during the installation process.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting:
* If you receive a mysql connection error, you may have run the installer multiple times â€“ in this case, the best solution is to reinstall your operating system and run the install script again.
* If you encounter Let's Encrypt SSL generation errors, make sure you have an A-Record for the domain pointing to your correct IP and if you use Cloudflare, make sure the proxy is turned off.
