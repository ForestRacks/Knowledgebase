# Manually Generate a TLS/SSL Certificate

## Locate current certificate
```bash
/usr/local/directadmin/directadmin config | egrep "^ssl=|^cacert=|^cakey="
```

## Generate certificate
Replace `<domain>` with the FQDN that you are generating a SSL/TLS certificate for.
```bash
/usr/local/directadmin/scripts/letsencrypt.sh request <domain> 2048
```
## Check new certificate status
The following is an example of how to check the DirectAdmin dashboard certificate but you may need to replace the path `/usr/local/directadmin/conf/cacert.pem` with the location of your new certificate
```bash
openssl x509 -in  /usr/local/directadmin/conf/cacert.pem -text -noout
```
## Build DirectAdmin with the new certificate
```bash
/usr/local/directadmin/custombuild/build rewrite_confs
```
