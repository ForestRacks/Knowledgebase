# Creating an SSH Key
This guide covers how create SSH keys in your home directory. You don't need to spcify the location with `-f` if you want it to save to the default location. You also are not required to specify a comment with `-C` but generally people put their email or name as the comment so its easier to distinguish who's key is whos.
