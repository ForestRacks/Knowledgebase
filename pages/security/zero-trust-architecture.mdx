# Zero-Trust Architectures

## What is Zero-Trust?
A Zero-Trust network architecture is a security model that assumes that all users, devices, and applications are operating in an untrusted environment. This means that all traffic is considered untrusted and must be verified before it is allowed to communicate with other resources. This is in contrast to the traditional security model, which assumes that all traffic within a network is trusted and only traffic from outside the network is untrusted.

## Why Zero-Trust?
Zero-Trust commonly allows networks segment traffic so certain teams only have access to parts of the network that they need access to. Zero-Trust also allows for more granular control over what traffic is allowed to communicate with what resources. This can help prevent lateral movement in the event of a breach. Zero-Trust also commonly implements required layers such as intranets, firewalls, VPNs, OAuth login requirements and MFA requirements to help prevent unauthorized access to resources.

## How to implement Zero-Trust?
Many companies make their own Zero-Trust systems with VPNs like OpenVPN or WireGuard or just use a service like Cloudflare Access, Palo Alto Networks Zero Trust, Tailscale, JumpCloud, or rPort.
