# Using Google Trust Services

Google Trust Services is a certificate authority operated by Google.

They unfortunately charge for their certificates, but they are relatively cheap. The benefit of Google Trust Services is they allow certificate redistribution and support IP certificates so its great for Saas providers.

Currently, Google charges a monthly fee of $20 and $0.30 per certificate ontop of that for the first 50,000 certificates. For more than 50,000 certificates, the price drops significantly.

Overall, Let's Encrypt is a better option for most people unless you have very specific needs that Let's Encrypt doesn't support.
