# Connect to sFTP with FileZilla

In this article we will show you how to connect using the most popular FTP client; Filezilla!

<Steps>
### Login and find server
First login on [https://panel.forestracks.com](https://panel.forestracks.com) and click on your server.
### Go to Settings
Next click the "Settings" panel tab
### Download FileZilla
Download the [Filezilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php) application from FileZilla's website
### Quick Connect
Use the information from our web-panel to signin on the quick connect bar:
* The "Host" input on FileZilla should be the "SERVER ADDRESS" from the ForestRacks "Settings" tab without the port so the Server Address `sftp://node.forestracks.net:2022` should be the FileZilla host `sftp://node.forestracks.net`
* The username input on FileZilla should be the username listed under the Server Address titled "USERNAME"
* The sFTP port on FileZilla should be `2022`
* Your password for FileZilla is your ForestRacks account password
