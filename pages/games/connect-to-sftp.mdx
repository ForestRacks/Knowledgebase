Congratulations, you found ForestRacks and now you're ready to connect to your to your servers SFTP for fast file transferring.

In this article we will show you how to connect using the most popular FTP client; Filezilla!

1) First login on [https://panel.forestracks.com](https://panel.forestracks.com) and click on your server.
2) Next click the "Settings" panel tab
3) Download the [Filezilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php) application from FileZilla's website
4) Use the information from our web-panel to signin on the quick connect bar:
* The "Host" input on FileZilla should be the "SERVER ADDRESS" from the ForestRacks "Settings" tab without the port so the Server Address `sftp://node.forestracks.net:2022` should be the FileZilla host `sftp://node.forestracks.net`
* The username input on FileZilla should be the username listed under the Server Address titled "USERNAME"
* The sFTP port on FileZilla should be `2022`
* Your password for FileZilla is your ForestRacks account password
