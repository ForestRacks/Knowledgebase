# Logging it to RCON

## Horde RCON Tool
You can log into RCON using the [Horde RCON Tool](https://pavlovhorde.com/rcon/) with your credentials from the [ForestRacks game server panel](https://panel.forestracks.com).

* The IP Address for signing in is the one found on the "Network" panel tab which should look something like `192.168.53.72`
* The RCON port is found on the "Startup" panel tab in the `RCON PORT` input box.
* The password is also found on the "Startup" panel tab but its in the `RCON PASSOWRD` input.

If you decide to change the RCON password, you can do so by modifying it in the `RCON PASSOWRD` input and then simply clicking "Restart" on the "Console" panel tab.

Don't hesitate to [contact us](/about/contact-us) if you need assistance with this process, we will also post a video tutorial and screenshots here in future.
