## Important Disclaimer

It's essential to be aware that while the .org TLD has historically been associated with nonprofit organizations, it is no longer exclusive to them. Individuals, businesses, and various entities can register .org domains. Therefore, when evaluating a website with a .org domain, it's essential to consider other factors, such as the website's content, reputation, and purpose, to assess its credibility.

Always exercise caution and verify the authenticity of websites, regardless of their TLD. Credibility should not be solely based on the TLD but on the website's content, source, and reputation.

Remember that TLDs are just one aspect of web addresses, and responsible internet use involves critical thinking and thorough verification of online information.
