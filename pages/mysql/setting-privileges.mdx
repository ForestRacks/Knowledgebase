# Setting MySQL User Privileges

This documentation page aims to provide a user-friendly guide on how to manage user permissions in MySQL.

## Granting All Permissions to a User on a Specific Database

To assign all permissions to the user `your_user` on the `your_database` database, follow these steps:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database.* TO 'your_user'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
This command grants the user `your_user` full access to perform any operation on the specified database. The "WITH GRANT OPTION" allows this user to grant or revoke privileges for other users.

## Granting All Permissions to a User on All Databases
If you want to grant all permissions to the user `your_user` on all databases, use the following command:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES *.* TO 'your_user'@'127.0.0.1';
```

This command assigns the user `your_user` with privileges across all databases. It enables the user to perform any operation on any table within any database.
