# Importing a database from a .sql file

## Import a .sql file from the MySQL command line
After entering the MySQL shell with the `mysql` command, you can use the "source" command to import `your_sql_file.sql`

First make sure that you change directories to where your .sql dump is located like `cd /root`

```sql
use db_name;
SET autocommit=0 ; source your_sql_file.sql ; COMMIT ;
```
## Import a .sql file from bash
Alternatively, you can import a .sql file from bash:
```bash
mysql -p db_name < your_sql_file.sql
```
