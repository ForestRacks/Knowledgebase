# Enabling Remote Connection to MySQL

## Creating a MySQL user for a remote IP.
For specifics on how [MySQL users](/mysql/setting-up-mysql#creating-a-mysql-user) work and how [MySQL privileges](/mysql/setting-up-mysql#setting-mysql-user-privileges) work, follow the corresponding guides but this example, is using the MySQL shell to allow access to the remote IP `192.168.53.72`.
```sql
# You should change the username and password below to something unique.
CREATE USER 'your_user'@'192.168.53.72' IDENTIFIED BY 'somePasswordHere';
# Allocate privileges to the user you created
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES *.* TO 'your_user'@'192.168.53.72';
```

## Changing the MySQL Configuration

To enable remote connections to your MySQL server, you need to modify the MySQL configuration file usually located at `/etc/my.cnf` but if you cannout find it, type `find /etc -iname my.cnf` to locate it.

1) Open the MySQL configuration `my.cnf` file using a text editor like nano or vim.
2) Add text below to the bottom of the file:
```ini filename="my.cnf" copy
[mysqld]
bind-address=0.0.0.0
```
4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Note: The IP address 0.0.0.0 is not a placeholder but rather the actual IP address you should bind to. Setting the `bind-address` to 0.0.0.0 instructs the MySQL server to bind to all available IP addresses.

## Firewall Setup
When modifying firewall rules, exercise caution and consider the security implications of allowing remote access to your MySQL server. It is recommended to restrict connections to trusted IP addresses and use secure authentication mechanisms.

### For UFW

If you are using the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) on your server, you can configure it to allow MySQL connections from specific IP addresses. Follow the instructions below:

1. Open a terminal or SSH session to your server.
2. Run the following command to allow MySQL connections from a specific IP address, replacing `192.168.53.72` with the desired IP:

```bash
ufw allow from 192.168.53.72 to any port 3306 proto tcp
```
Alternatively, to allow connections from all remote IP addresses, use the following command:
```bash
ufw allow 3306/tcp
```
### For IPTables
```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
```

### For Nftables
```bash
nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 3306 accept
```
