# MySQL Corruption Recovery:

To fix corruption in MySQL databases or tables, here are a couple methods you can try. Please note that data corruption isn't fool proof and won't always work. Here at ForestRacks we generally take daily backups of all customer products so if recovery fails, don't hesitate to [contact us](/about/contact-us) and we will see what we can do.

In this example, the database is called `billing` and the table is called `statements`.

```bash

```
### Select the `billing` database
```sql
use billing;
```
### Run the optimize command on your corrupted table
```sql
OPTIMIZE TABLE statements;
```
</Steps>
