# Skip MySQL Password Authentication

For certain software you may need to temporarily disable your MySQL root password authentication.

## Closing MySQL on the firewall
When disabling authentication, it is highly recommended that your firewall is closed, make sure you read the guide specific to your firewall software to accomplish this and use a port tester to make sure the port is actually closed before starting the next step.

For UFW, check the status of your UFW rules by running the following command:
```bash
ufw status numbered
```
To delete the rule, use the following command, replacing `<rule_number>` with the actual number of the rule you want to delete:
```bash
ufw delete <rule_number>
```
For example, if the rule number is 3, the command would be:
```bash
sudo ufw delete 3
```


## Disable the service
For MariaDB:
```bash
systemctl stop mariadb
```
For MySQL:
```bash
systemctl stop mysql
```

## Turn on MySQLd safe mode
```bash
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking
```

## Enter the MySQL Shell
```bash
mysql -u root
```
