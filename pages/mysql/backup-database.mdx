# Taking a database backup
To protect your data, you should regularly take backups of your database into a .sql dump

## Dump into separate .sql files
You can backup each MySQL database into its own individual .sql file by using:
```sql
mysql -s -r -e 'show databases' | while read db; do mysqldump $db > ${db}.sql; done 
```
