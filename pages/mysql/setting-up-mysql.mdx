# Setting up MySQL

<Steps>
### Installing MySQL
Either install MySQL or MariaDB. To Install MariaDB, you can follow [our guide](/mysql/installing-mariadb).

### Creating a MySQL User

1) Enter the MySQL shell by typing `mysql` in your terminal
2) Create a database, the following example is creating a database called `your_database`:
```sql copy
CREATE USER 'your_user'@'192.168.53.72' IDENTIFIED BY 'somePasswordHere';
```

### Creating a MySQL Database

1) Enter the MySQL shell by typing `mysql` in your terminal
2) Create a user, the following example is creating a user called `your_user`:
```sql copy
CREATE DATABASE your_database;
```

### Setting MySQL User Privileges

This documentation page aims to provide a user-friendly guide on how to manage user permissions in MySQL.

#### Granting All Permissions to a User on a Specific Database

To assign all permissions to the user `your_user` on the `your_database` database, follow these steps:
```sql copy
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database.* TO 'your_user'@'127.0.0.1';
```
This command grants the user `your_user` full access to perform any operation on the specified database.

#### Granting All Permissions to a User on All Databases
If you want to grant all permissions to the user `your_user` on all databases, use the following command:
```sql copy
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'your_user'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

This command assigns the user `your_user` with privileges across all databases. It enables the user to perform any operation on any table within any database.  The "WITH GRANT OPTION" allows this user to grant or revoke privileges for other users.
